The main objective of dimensionality reduction is this: find a low-dimensional representation of the data that retains as much information as possible.

* PCA tries to find another representation of the data (another set of features), such that the features in this representation have the highest possible variance and lowest possible covariance.
* t-SNE takes a set of points in a high-dimensional space and find a faithful representation of those points in a lower-dimensional space, typically the 2D plane
* t-SNE is capable of capturing much of the local structure of the high-dimensional data very well, while also revealing global structure such as the presence of clusters at several scales.

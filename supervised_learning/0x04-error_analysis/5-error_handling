1. High Bias, High Variance:  Train more 
                              Try a different architecture 
                              Build a deeper network
                              
2. High Bias, Low Variance: Train more
                            Try a different architecture
                            Build a deeper network
                            
3. Low Bias, High Variance: Try a different architecture 
                            Get more data 
                            Use regularization
                            
4. Low Bias, Low Variance:  All good, do nothing

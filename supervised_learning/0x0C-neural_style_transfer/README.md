                            Neural Style Transfer


Creating Art with Deep Learning using tf.keras and eager execution
Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take three images, a content image, a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter), and the input image you want to style — and blend them together such that the input image is transformed to look like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style image.

The main objective of dimensionality reduction is to find a low-dimensional representation of the data that retains as much information as possible.

* PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a technique that converts n-dimensions of data into k-dimensions while maintaining as much information from the original dataset. 

* t-SNE(T- distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is also a method to reduce the dimension. It takes a set of points in a high-dimensional space and find a faithful representation of those points in a lower-dimensional space.

=> t-SNE is capable of capturing much of the local structure of the high-dimensional data very well, while also revealing global structure such as the presence of clusters at several scales.


We are using MNIST dataset for knowing more about PCA and t-SNE.

# **Clustering**

##  K-Means:
K-Means is a popular non-probabilistic clustering algorithm. The goal of the algorithm is to minimize the distortion measure J. We achieve that by the following iterative procedure:
* 1-Choose the number of clusters K
* 2-Initialize the vector μ_k that defines a central point of each cluster
* 3-Assign each data point x to the closest cluster centre
* 4-Recalculate central points μ_k for each cluster
* 5-Repeat 3–4 until central points stop moving

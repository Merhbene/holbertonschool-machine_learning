# Attention 

Attention is a mechanism combined in the RNN allowing it to focus on certain parts of the input sequence when predicting a certain part of the output sequence, enabling easier learning and of higher quality.

Combination of attention mechanisms enabled improved performance in many tasks making it an integral part of modern RNN networks.
